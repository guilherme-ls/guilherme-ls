## About me

I am Guilherme Schmidt, currently in my third year as a computer engineering student at University of SÃ£o Paulo, and acting president of Zenith EESC-USP, an aerospace research group. In 2022 I graduated as a mechanic, having knowledge mainly about fabrication methods (milling and welding), materials engineering, and mechanical design through Inventor and Autocad. During 4 years I've worked on an Astronomy research project, having published 2 articles and acquired practical experience in the use of telescopes.
